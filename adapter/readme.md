"The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets
classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces."

In this example the UncoolClass is using the interface of the CoolClass to get into the coolClub. If I could have come up with
a better example this would be a demonstration of how we can extend our desired interface (the CoolClass, in this example) to wrap
the functionality of our undesired interface (the UncoolClass), while still making use of the functionality in the class that has the
undesired interface.
