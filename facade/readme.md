"The Facade Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level
interface that makes the subsystem easier to use."

In a real example the functions we're wrapping would probably be a subsystem of classes, but, this is a simple example for a simple - but
powerful - pattern. To a casual observer the output looks the same, but for programmers, we've cut down on the amount we have to write,
and, possibly duplicate in a project.
